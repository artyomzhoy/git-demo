Though wounds were great, and respite scant
Life clung to that wretched plant
Its skin was scarred, its leaves were ripped
Damned to wait, as roots were fixed
For every hour, in hopeless fear
It felt them leave then draw back near
The insects drudged without a sound
And tore the plant down to the ground
Among them, one drone like any other
Stole away to meet another
Far from the swarm, the two had hidden
Their unborn child, which was forbidden
Spiteful mind and eyes unseen
Betrayed unto to a ruthless Queen
